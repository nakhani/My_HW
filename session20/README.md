# Session 20

In this session, I completed 3 mini programs and an assignment about SQL:
  
- I designed a **GAME** where a user plays against two computer opponents. The user must choose between âœ‹ and ðŸ¤š. If the user's choice differs from the other two players, the user earns 1 point. After 5 rounds, the player with the highest score wins. :

- And also, write **symmetrical array checker Program**, which checks input array if it is symmetrical or not 

- My third program is  **pairs list Generator** which generate pairs include boys and girls name which are at the same pair

- My SQL assignment is about simple sql language syntax like **INSERT**, **UPDATE**,**DELETE**, **SELECT**

## Python

I use [**Pyside6**](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/), A module which provides a set of C++ technologies for building user interfaces. The QtWidgets module provides a set of UI elements to create classic desktop-style user interfaces.
