# Projects

## Video to Audio Converter

This folder contains two Python scripts for converting video files to audio files. One script uses multi-threading for concurrent processing, and the other processes files sequentially without multi-threading.

## Fast Downloader

Fast Downloader is a Python application that allows users to download files concurrently using threading. It features a PySide6-based GUI with a dark mode theme.

## Spaceship Game

In this session, I completed a Spaceship GAME which has the following features:

- If bullets fired from a spaceship hit each enemy, you earn 1 point.

- If each enemy passes your territory, you lose one of your hearts.

- If the spaceship collides with each enemy, it is GAME OVER.

- If you lose your 3 hearts, it is GAME OVER.

- If you earn 10 points, you WIN.
