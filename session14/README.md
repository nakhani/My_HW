My program has below features:

- If bullets fired from a spaceship hit each enemy, you earn 1 point
- If each enemy passes your territory, you lose one of your hearts
- If you collide with each enemy, it is **GAME OVER**
- If you lose your 3 hearts, it is **GAME OVER** 
- If you earn 10 points, you **WIN**
